# Project: Sentiment Analysis

## Install

This project requires **Python 2.7** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NLTK] (http://www.nltk.org/)
- [re](https://docs.python.org/2/library/re.html)
- [scikit-learn] (http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
- [keras] (https://keras.io/)
- [matplotlib] (http://matplotlib.org/)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html).

If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads) distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and more included. Make sure that you select the Python 2.7 installer and not the Python 3.x installer.


## Run

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory `sentiment_analysis/` (that contains this README), and run one of the following commands:

```bash
ipython notebook sentiment_analysis.ipynb
```  
or
```bash
jupyter notebook sentiment_analysis.ipynb
```


## Data

The “Large Movie Review Dataset” contains 25,000 highly polar movie reviews for training, and another 25,000 reviews for testing. In both training and testing data sets, there are 50% positive reviews and 50% negative reviews. More information can be found on the [Stanford AI Lab](http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/).
